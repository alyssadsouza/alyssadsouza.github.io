## What is it?

I designed and implemented the UI for this, as well as set up the backend API endpoints and helped with some of the data processing and integration for the app.

We used React with Typescript and Tailwind for styling. We used React Router for the routing and the Axios library for making our API requests.

For the backend I tried out FastAPI for the first time and had simple GET requests to our API, which would run its major processing using custom web scrapers, Cohere's API for sentiment analysis, and the nltk Python library for adjective counts.
